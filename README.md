# Vue 3 Personal Website

## Project Description
This is a **Vue 3 personal website** built using **Vite**. It includes multiple sections with interactive features, such as:
- A **Home Section** with a dynamic welcome message.
- A **Projects Section** displaying a list of projects.
- A **Contact Section** with a form (data persists using `localStorage`).

The website features a **Navy Blue & Bright Red** color scheme

# Issues Faced
- Folder Structure Issue: Initially, the Vue files were placed in the wrong directory, preventing them from loading. This was fixed by organizing components properly.

- Styling Issues: Adjustments were made to the navbar, footer, and form alignment to maintain a professional look.
